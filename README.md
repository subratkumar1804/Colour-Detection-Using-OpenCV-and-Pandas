# Colour-Detection-Using-OpenCV-and-Pandas

Color detection is the process of detecting name of the color. Here this is easy task for humans to detect the color and choose one.
But computer cannot detect the color easily. This is tough task for computer to detect the color easily. So that’s why we choose this project.
Many of the project and research papers are written on this problem. But we use different techniques for this project. Naive Bayes algorithm, Pandas and OpenCV libraries used in python languages.

Here we describe how we use OpenCV and pandas’ libraries. OpenCV, Pandas and NumPy are the necessary for this project in python to install them.
We are using argparse library to create an argument parser.
We can directly give an image path from the command prompt.
The panda’s library is very useful when we need to perform various operations on data files like CSV.pd. read_csv () reads the CSV file into the pandas Data Frame.
We have assigned each column with a name for easy accessing.
OpenCV Library is useful for detect the image and color values and name. It will calculate the RGB value of the pixels. The functions the parameters have the event name (X, Y) coordinates of the position. This is called draw function. Which was created by OpenCV and Pandas.

<h3>How To Run: </h3>
<p>Open Pycharm IDE.</p>
<p>Install OpenCV and Pandas Module</p> 
<p>Run the file using the command python filname.py --image (img name)</p>
